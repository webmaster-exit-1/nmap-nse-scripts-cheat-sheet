# Enhanced Cheat Sheet Release

This new release includes comprehensive updates and improvements to the Nmap NSE Scripts Cheat Sheet. Key updates include:

- A Jump-Bar minimap for quick navigation among scripts by letter.
- Enhanced formatting with GitHub Markdown to improve readability.
- Corrections and typos fixed for several scripts, such as creds-summary.nse, qconn-exec.nse, and vulners.nse.
- Critical missing scripts added for vulnerability detection and security scanning.
- Top 10 must-run scripts categorized by phases (Discovery, Scanning, etc.). 

Efforts were made to make this the "Holy Grail" of Nmap cheat sheets.
